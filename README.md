#  Auth-backend

## API Specs documentation: https://jdevtree-org.github.io/jdevtree-documentation/

The `auth-backend` is the authentication and authorization microservice of **jdevtree** ‚Äî a modular, production-grade developer platform built to showcase fullstack skills, modern architecture, and cloud-native design.

This service handles all identity-related operations, including:

- OAuth2 login (GitHub)
- Local username/password login
- JWT-based authentication and token rotation
- Redis-based refresh token reuse detection
- Secure registration and password management
- GitHub account linking
- Centralized response format
- PII masking and CSRF protection (in progress)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot 3.x** (Java 17+)
- **Gradle** build system
- **Spring Security** with OAuth2 + JWT
- **Redis** (for refresh token storage and blacklist)
- **PostgreSQL** (for user persistence)
- **Docker** (containerized services)
- **WebClient** (for external GitHub API calls)
- **Swagger / OpenAPI** (planned)
- **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions (planned)
- **Deployed to AWS Free Tier** via Terraform (planned)
